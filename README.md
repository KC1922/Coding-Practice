# Simple Code Demonstrations

This repository serves as a showcase of small code exercises that I've worked on to demonstrate my programming skills and practice in various languages, including Java and C#. The code showcased is simple and serves as a way for me to practice the language and exhibit an understanding of key concepts. Larger projects will be located in their own repositories.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Display my coding style and problem-solving approach.
- Demonstrate proficiency in languages such as Java and C#.
- Provide a portfolio of my coding projects.

Feel free to explore the code and solutions. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

## Languages

The repository includes code exercises written in:

- Java
- C# (Not yet added)

## How to Explore

1. Navigate to the language directory of your choice.
2. Browse through individual exercises and their solutions.
3. Gain insights into my coding techniques and strategies.

I hope you find the code insightful and enjoy exploring my solutions.
