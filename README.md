# Simple Code Demonstrations

This repository serves as a showcase of small code exercises that I've worked on to demonstrate my programming skills and practice in various languages, including Java and C#.
The code showcased are simple, and merely for me to practice the language and show understanding of key concepts. Larger projects will be located in their own repositories.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Display my coding style and problem-solving approach.
- Demonstrate proficiency in languages such as Java and C#.
- Provide a portfolio of my coding projects.

Feel free to explore the code and solutions. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

## Languages

The repository includes code exercises written in:

- Java
- C# (Not yet added)

## How to Explore

1. Navigate to the language directory of your choice.
2. Browse through individual exercises and their solutions.
3. Gain insights into my coding techniques and strategies.

I hope you find the code insightful and enjoy exploring my projects.

# Overview of File Directories
## Java

This directory contains the following files:

## array_reverse.java

- **File Name:** array_reverse.java
- **Description:** Simple program that lets user populate an array of 10 elements and then reverses the array. Elements can be anything, not just integers.
- **Concepts Demonstrated:** Arrays, for loops, user input, methods.

## max_min.java

- **File Name:** max_min.java
- **Description:** Simple program that takes in a list of numbers and determines the maximum and minimum values. User can also choose to find the 2nd, 3rd, etc. largest/smallest values with error checking to ensure the user doesn't enter a value larger than the list size.
- **Concepts Demonstrated:** Sorting, algorithms, user input, methods, functions.

## palindrome.java

- **File Name:** palindrome.java
- **Description:** Simple program that takes in a string and determines if it is a palindrome or not. 
- **Concepts Demonstrated:** String manipulation, algorithms.

## string_reverse.java

- **File Name:** string_reverse.java
- **Description:** Simple program that takes in a string and reverses it. Specifically, reverses word order, not character order.
- **Concepts Demonstrated:** String manipulation.

## swapping_values.java

- **File Name:** swapping_values.java
- **Description:** Simple program that takes in two values and swaps them without using a temporary variable or reassignment.
- **Concepts Demonstrated:** Bitwise operators, arithmetic manipulation.
