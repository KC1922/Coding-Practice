## Solution to LeetCode problem 178
## https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/description/

## My code makes use of a window function. Window functions provide the ability to perform calculations 
## across sets of rows that are related to the current query row as per the documentation.
## In this problem, I select score from the Scores table and order them by score descending. I also select
## using the dense_rank() function which returns the relative rank of the current row, that is (rank - 1) / (total partition rows - 1)
## and order them by score.

SELECT score, dense_rank()
    OVER(
        ORDER BY score DESC
    ) AS rank
FROM Scores 
ORDER BY score DESC
