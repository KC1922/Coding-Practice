## Solution to Leet Code problem 180
## https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers/description/
## This solution makes use of the LEAD() function to peer into the next row and a CTE (common table entry).
## The CTE  "RankedNums" selects the "num" column from the "Logs" table and uses the LEAD() function to peek into the next two rows 
## (LEAD(num, 1) and LEAD(num, 2)). This creates two additional columns, "num1" and "num2", which represent the next two numbers in the 
## sequence for each row.


WITH RankedNums AS (
    SELECT num,
    LEAD(num, 1) OVER() num1,
    LEAD(num, 2) OVER() num2
    FROM Logs
)
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums 
FROM RankedNums
WHERE (num=num1) AND (num1=num2);
