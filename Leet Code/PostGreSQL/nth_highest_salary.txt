## Solution to LeetCode problem 177: Nth Highest Salary

SELECT DISTINCT(E.salary) FROM Employee E
        ORDER BY E.salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET (N - 1)

OR

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION NthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS TABLE (Salary INT) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY (
    SELECT DISTINCT E1.salary AS NthHighestSalary
    FROM Employee E1
    WHERE N = (
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT E2.salary) 
        FROM Employee E2 
        WHERE E2.salary >= E1.salary
    )
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

first solution is faster, but would not cover an edge case
