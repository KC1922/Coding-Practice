## Solution to problem 181 of LeetCode
## https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-earning-more-than-their-managers/description/

## We must find which employees earn more than their managers, which is done with the following.

SELECT E2.name AS Employee 
FROM Employee E1
INNER JOIN Employee E2 ON E1.id = E2.managerID
WHERE E1.salary < E2.salary

## We use an inner join to create table E1 which is populated with only the managers and E2 which is only the employees
## Then we simply compare the salaries in the two tables.
