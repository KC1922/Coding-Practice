## Joins

    (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
    LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
    RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
    FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

## Grouping

    The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
    It is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

## Relationships (Database Schemas)

    One-to-One Relationship:
        In a one-to-one relationship, each record in one table is related to exactly one record in another table, and vice versa.
        Types:
            Non-identifying: The foreign key in the child table can be NULL, meaning the relationship is optional.
            Identifying: The foreign key in the child table cannot be NULL, meaning the relationship is mandatory.

    One-to-Many Relationship:
        In a one-to-many relationship, each record in one table can be related to multiple records in another table, 
        but each record in the second table is related to only one record in the first table.
        Types:
            Non-identifying: The foreign key in the child table can be NULL, allowing for optional relationships.
            Identifying: The foreign key in the child table cannot be NULL, indicating a mandatory relationship.
            Recursive: The relationship exists within a single table, where records are related to other records within the same table.

    Many-to-Many Relationship:
        In a many-to-many relationship, each record in one table can be related to multiple records in another table, and vice versa.
        This type of relationship requires a junction table, also known as an associative or linking table, 
        to facilitate the connection between the two tables.
